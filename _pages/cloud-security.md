## Best Practice Cloud Deployment  

Our cloud deployment services are designed to help you get it right from the start. We provide expert guidance on selecting the right cloud model (public, private or hybrid), ensuring your environment is built with security embedded at every layer. By following industry best practices, we deliver:  

- **Secure configuration** aligned to frameworks such as the ASD Essential 8 and international standards.  
- **Resilient architectures** that support high availability and disaster recovery.  
- **Cost-efficient deployments** that balance performance, compliance and budget.  

This approach ensures that your cloud environment not only meets immediate needs but remains sustainable and secure as your organisation grows.

## Architecture Review  

Many organisations move quickly into the cloud without a clear view of the risks. Our architecture review service provides a thorough evaluation of your current setup to identify security gaps, misconfigurations, and opportunities for optimisation.  

We review areas such as:  

- Identity and access management (IAM) controls.  
- Network segmentation and firewalling.  
- Data protection and encryption practices.  
- Logging, monitoring and incident response capabilities.  

Following the review, we deliver a comprehensive report with prioritised recommendations—giving you a clear pathway to strengthening both security and performance.

## Security Hardening  

Protecting against today’s evolving cyber threats requires more than a basic setup. Our cloud hardening service helps you reduce attack surface and improve resilience against compromise. We work closely with your team to:  

- Apply **industry-standard benchmarks** (CIS, Microsoft, AWS, Azure, Google Cloud).  
- Implement advanced **network security controls**, including zero-trust principles.  
- Strengthen **authentication and authorisation policies**, such as MFA enforcement.  
- Improve **data protection measures**, from encryption to secure backups.  

By layering these protections, we create a robust defence posture tailored to your environment and threat landscape.
