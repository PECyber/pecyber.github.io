Every organisation needs strong cyber security leadership, but not every organisation can justify the cost of a full-time Chief Information Security Officer. Thatâ€™s where our **Virtual CISO (vCISO) services** come in. A vCISO provides the same strategic guidance, governance, and leadership as a traditional CISOâ€”delivered flexibly, at a fraction of the cost.  

At PECyber, our Virtual CISOs partner with you to **develop security strategy, manage risk, achieve compliance, and uplift resilience**. Whether youâ€™re an SME, government agency, or service provider, we give you executive-level cyber security leadershipâ€”without the overhead.

## Why Choose a Virtual CISO?

Cyber threats are growing, and boards are increasingly accountable for demonstrating cyber resilience. Yet most small to medium-sized organisations cannot afford (or donâ€™t need) a full-time Chief Information Security Officer.  

By engaging a **Virtual Chief Information Security Officer**, you gain:  

- **Strategic direction** aligned to your business objectives.  
- **Experienced security leadership** available when you need it.  
- **Independent advice** without vendor bias.  
- **Budget efficiency**, with access to senior expertise at a fraction of the salary of a full-time executive.  
- **Scalability**, allowing you to increase or decrease vCISO hours as your organisation evolves.  

Our Virtual CISOs are not consultants who deliver a report and walk away. They become **trusted partners** who work alongside your leadership team to embed lasting security improvements.

## What a vCISO Can Do for You

A **Virtual CISO service** covers the same responsibilities you would expect from an in-house security executive, but delivered with flexibility:  

- Development of cyber security strategies and roadmaps.  
- Oversight of compliance programs (ASD Essential 8, ISO 27001, PSPF, NIST CSF).  
- Risk assessments, prioritisation, and mitigation planning.  
- Executive reportingâ€”translating technical issues into clear business impacts.  
- Security awareness and culture uplift.  
- Guidance for internal IT teams and managed service providers.  
- Preparation for external audits, tenders, or regulator reviews.  

In short, your **Virtual CISO provides the governance, leadership, and accountability you need to mature your security posture.**

## Incident CISO Services â€“ Cyber Leadership in a Crisis

When a cyber security incident strikes, decisions need to be made quickly. Technical teams may understand the issue, but lack the executive presence to coordinate stakeholders, engage regulators, and protect reputations.  

Our **Incident CISO service** ensures you have an experienced leader at the table when it matters most.  

**During a cyber incident, a PECyber Virtual CISO can:**  
- Take executive control of response coordination.  
- Align IT, legal, HR, and communications teams.  
- Manage engagement with the Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC), regulators, and law enforcement.  
- Guide decisions on containment, eradication, and recovery.  
- Prepare board updates and executive communications.  
- Lead the post-incident lessons-learned review and resilience uplift.  

This service provides peace of mind that in the worst-case scenario, your business has **executive-level incident leadership** on call.

## vCISO vs Full-Time CISO â€“ A Comparison

| **Aspect** | **Virtual CISO (vCISO)** | **Full-Time CISO** |
|------------|---------------------------|--------------------|
| **Cost** | Fraction of the cost of an executive salary | $200k+ annual salary plus benefits |
| **Flexibility** | Scalable hoursâ€”engage as little or as much as needed | Fixed full-time resource |
| **Expertise** | Exposure to multiple industries, tools, and frameworks | Deep knowledge of one organisation |
| **Availability** | On-demand, remote or on-site | Internal presence, office-based |
| **Best for** | SMEs, government agencies, MSPs needing expert guidance | Large enterprises with complex operations |

Many of our clients use a **Virtual Chief Information Security Officer** as a stepping stone: once their security maturity and budget grow, they may transition to a full-time CISO role. Until then, a **vCISO bridges the gap perfectly.**
