Enhance your cybersecurity posture through proactive and reactive purple team engagements with ProtectiveEdge Cyber.

## Comprehensive Purple Team Exercises
Our purple team exercises are designed to combine proactive and reactive strategies to bolster your organisation's cybersecurity posture. These engagements help identify weaknesses, improve response capabilities, and foster a culture of continuous improvement in your security operations.

## Incident Tabletop Exercises
We facilitate incident tabletop exercises to help your team practise and refine their response to various cybersecurity scenarios. These exercises provide a safe environment to test incident response plans, identify gaps, and enhance coordination among team members.

## Post Incident Support
After a cybersecurity incident, it's crucial to learn from the experience to prevent future occurrences. Our team helps facilitate a thorough review of the incident, identifying what went well and areas for improvement. We provide actionable recommendations to strengthen your defences and response capabilities.

## SOC and Red Team Emulation
Our purple team engagements include emulating both Security Operations Centre (SOC) and red team activities to test and enhance your defences. We simulate real-world attack scenarios and evaluate your SOC's detection and response capabilities, providing valuable insights and improvement opportunities.
