# SMB1001 Certification Services

## Achieving Cyber Resilience Through SMB1001  
The **SMB1001:2025 Cybersecurity Standard** is designed specifically for Australian small and medium businesses (SMBs) to demonstrate a strong and practical cybersecurity posture. The standard provides a maturity-based approach, ensuring organisations can progressively improve their defences in line with their size, resources, and risk profile.

PECyber supports organisations at every stage of their SMB1001 journey. As an authorised certifier, we can **certify organisations up to Bronze level** directly. For businesses seeking higher maturity outcomes, PECyber provides full **consulting, readiness, and uplift support through to Silver and Gold** certification levels.
